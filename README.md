# Agrobiodiversity mind map
Hello!
This is a project being carried out at the <a href="http://www.biocomp.org.br/">BioComp laboratory</a> of the University of São Paulo in partnership with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). 

The main reference source used from where the concepts and definitions in the map came from is:
FAO. 2019. The State of the World’s Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture. J. Bélanger & D. Pilling (eds.). FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture Assessments. Rome. doi: https://doi.org/10.4060/CA3129EN.

Feel free to use this framework for any purpose, but remember to cite the source. Remember that this is an under-development version, so keep following this repository to see the new version releases. 

The mind map provided has a .cmap extension. To open this file, we recommend you to download the <a href="https://cmap.ihmc.us/cmaptools/">CmapTools</a> (desktop version). The software can be downloaded for free. 
We recommend not to use the web version of CmapTools since it doesn't support the ellipses used in the mind map.
