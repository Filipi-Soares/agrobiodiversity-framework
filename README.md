# Agrobiodiversity mind map
Hello!
This map is part of a project being carried out at the <a href="http://www.biocomp.org.br/">BioComp laboratory</a> of the University of São Paulo in partnership with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). Downlod the latest version <a href="https://github.com/Filipi-Soares/agrobiodiversity-framework/blob/master/agobio_mind_map_v.1.02.cmap">here</a>. 

The main reference source from which the concepts and definitions in the map came from is:

FAO. 2019. <i>The State of the World’s Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture</i>. J. Bélanger & D. Pilling (eds.). FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture Assessments. Rome. doi: https://doi.org/10.4060/CA3129EN.

Feel free to use this mind map for any purpose but remember to cite the source. Remember that this is an under-development version, so keep following this repository to see when a new version is released. 

The mind map provided has a .cmap extension. To open this file, we recommend you to download the <a href="https://cmap.ihmc.us/cmaptools/">CmapTools</a> (desktop version). The software can be downloaded for free. 
We recommend not to use the web version of CmapTools since it doesn't support the ellipses used in the mind map.
