# Agrobiodiversity mind map
Hello!
This is a project being carried out at the <a href="http://www.biocomp.org.br/">BioComp laboratory</a> of the University of SÃ£o Paulo in partnership with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). Feel free to use this framework for any purpose, but remember to cite the source.
The mind mao provided has a .log extension. To open this file, we recommend you to download the <a href="https://cmap.ihmc.us/cmaptools/">CmapTools</a> (desktop version). The software can be downloaded for free. 
We recommend not to use the web version of CmapTools since it doesn't support the ellipses used in the mind map.
